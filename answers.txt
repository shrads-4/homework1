What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Merge and rebase are two different ways of incorporating changes from one branch into another in Git.
Merging is a non-destructive way to combine branches, preserving their individual histories,
while rebasing provides a cleaner, linear history because it moves the changes from one branch onto
another branch.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a central hub where a Git project's code and history are stored,
which makes it possible for multiple developers to work together on a project.
